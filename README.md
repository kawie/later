My first SvelteKit app

This app allows you to take a photo and will then display it. You can take a new one to overwrite it. It won't save it to your camera roll, and should work completely offline (i hope!)

## Why?
We have this Now-Next-Later board in the office, with post-its posted on the TV. You can see it in the example image above. It's a great tool for organizing our work, and I like having it in the physical space. However, when I work from home, I miss being able to look at it - so I took a picture. After a few weeks, I got tired of it cluttering up my camera roll, so I built this app.

Also, I got to play around a little bit with some new tech:
- SvelteKit, which I had been meaning to explore (we use Svelte at Steady now)
- CodeSandbox.io, which is nice, but a little bit overkill for this project
- Fly.io, an absolute pleasure
